  Coffea arabica, also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of Arabia",
  "mountain coffee", or "arabica coffee", is a species of Coffea. It is believed
  to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the dominant
  cultivar, representing some 60% of global production. Coffee produced from the
  less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean makes up
  the preponderance of the balance.
